height of a node: length of path from that node to the deepest leaf node. Eg here height of D is 2 ( D - E - F )

depth of a node: length of path from root to that node Eg depth of D is 1 (A - D )

size of a node: number of descendents it has including itself Eg size of node D is 4 ( D, E, G, F)
